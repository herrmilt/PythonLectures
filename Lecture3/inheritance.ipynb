    "Containment delegation and inheritance are both object-oriented programming concepts that allow\n",
    "one object to use the functionality of another object. However, there are some advantages to using\n",
    "containment delegation over inheritance:\n",
    "- Flexibility: Containment delegation allows for greater flexibility than inheritance because it can be used to combine functionality from multiple objects. In contrast, inheritance creates a tight coupling between a class and its parent class, which can limit the flexibility of the design.\n",
    "- Encapsulation: Containment delegation supports better encapsulation of objects than inheritance because it allows objects to control their internal state and expose only the necessary functionality. This makes the design more modular and easier to maintain.\n",
    "- Composition: Containment delegation supports composition, which is the process of combining simpler objects to create more complex ones. This is useful when the functionality needed is not available in a single class or when the functionality needs to change dynamically at runtime.\n",
    "- Reduced complexity: Containment delegation can help to reduce the complexity of the code by breaking it down into smaller, more manageable pieces. In contrast, inheritance can create complex class hierarchies that are di\u001e",
    "cult to understand and maintain.\n",
    "- Testing: Containment delegation can make it easier to test code because it allows objects to be tested in isolation. In contrast, inheritance can make testing more dificult because changes made to a parent class can affect all of its child classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, containment delegation can be a powerful tool for designing flexible, modular, and maintainable object-oriented software. While inheritance can also be useful in certain situations, containment delegation is often a better choice when flexibility and maintainability are top priorities."

    "# Polymorphism\n",
    "\n",
    "Polymorphism is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming that allows objects of\n",
    "different classes to be treated as if they are the same type. In Python, polymorphism is achieved\n",
    "through the use of a common interface or set of methods that all objects in a particular class\n",
    "hierarchy share. This interface allows objects of different classes to be used interchangeably, making\n",
    "code more flexible and reusable.\n",
    "\n",
    "One common example of polymorphism in Python is with the use of the built-in len() function. The\n",
    "len() function can be used to determine the length of various types of objects, such as strings, lists,\n",
    "and dictionaries. This is possible because these objects all implement the common len () method,\n",
    "which the len() function calls internally."

    "Another example of polymorphism in Python is with the use of inheritance. When a subclass\n",
    "inherits from a superclass, it gains access to all of the superclass's methods and attributes. This\n",
    "allows the subclass to be used in the same way as the superclass, which makes code more modular\n",
